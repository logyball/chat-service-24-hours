# chat-service-24-hours

A really stupid project.  Trying to hack together an HTTP-server-based chat service by myself in <24 hours. 

The results from <24 hours are saved off on the `24_hours` branch.  I can't reasonably have that code be the _first_ thing anyone sees while still touting myself as a "professional developer", so I've made some modifications to have this live in a less embarassing state.

[A full writeup of the experience is here](https://loganballard.com/index.php/2021/09/06/24-hours-in-go/).
